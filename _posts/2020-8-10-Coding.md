This is to produce Figure 9.8, 9.10 in RL book.

## **Figure 9.8**

The problem is to approximate a window function by Coarse Coding. In Coarse Coding, features overlap, in order word, one state can be affected by multiple weights (corresponding to multiple features).

In 2D space, the feature can be circles or any other shapes. However, in 1D space (in this problem), features are line segments, each responsible for a set of states. To illustrate the relationship between features, feature vector and weight vector, look at the plot specifically produced for this problem.

 The width of each feature, the offset and how much the left most and right most feature extend out of the range can be arbitrary. But from experience, it is better to keep them symmetric.

 We get something similar to Figure 9.8 in the book as follows.

## **Figure 9.10**

Similar to Coarse Coding, in 2D space, features are formed to be grids, and in 1D space, it becomes something like rulers. The Tile Coding setup for Figure 9.10 is shown in the figure below.

  <div style="text-align:center"><img src="/files/Chapter9/Coarse_Tile_Coding/CT_p1.png" alt="drawing" width="700"/></div>

With weight vector and feature vector, we simply take dot product of them to get estimated value, as given in the book:

$$ \hat{v}(s) = \mathbf{w}^\top \mathbf{x}(s) $$

Here, with weight matrix and feature matrix, we first multiply them element by element, and then sum over all elements.

Then, it is not hard to get Figure 9.10 in the book. With 50 tilings, it is extremely computationally costly, so I averaged them over only 10 runs.

## **Code Usage**

Download the code [Coarse_Tile_coding](https://github.com/MingruiSun2019/RLbook_reproducing/tree/master/Chapter9/Coarse_Tile_coding).

To produce the left figure in Figure 9.3 and 9.4:
{% highlight Bash %}
python3 Figure9_3.py
python3 Figure9_4.py {% endhighlight %}


To produce Figure 9.8:
{% highlight Bash %}
python3 Coarse_Coding.py {% endhighlight %}


To produce Figure 9.10, we will need the state distribution and true state value as reference. It is the same thing which has already generated in previous examples, see [Fourier_Poly_Basis](https://github.com/MingruiSun2019/RLbook_reproducing/tree/master/Chapter9/Fourier_Poly_Basis). So, before running the following commends, make sure you have these two files (`distribution_iter.npy` and `true_val.npy`) in the `./npy_file` folder.
{% highlight Bash %}
python3 Get_RMS.py
python3 plot_VE {% endhighlight %}







**The End**
